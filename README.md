# ML-Homework-2
The adaline.py file contaisn the adaline algorithm from the text book. SImilartly the Perceptron.py holds the perceptron algorithm from teh textbook.

My own version of the perceptron is named myPerceptron.py
- my basic logic and reasoning for the code:
- using class labels 1 and -1 for my data
- i need to create matrix for the weights, featurs and one for the features.
- initialize the weights to 0.
- set an epoch so it iterates thorugh all the data set as many times as i want
- compare the predictive label with the correct label and then update the weights
-   how am i going ot get this in code???
-   do i need to worry about errors?
-
